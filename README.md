## Overview

This is my solution to the interactive rating component with HTML, CSS and Javascript, its responsive, I applied all good practice than a know, I decided to use a form with radio input elements to select the rate, but the input are not display, I just styled the associated label element, I don't know if this is correct, if you see some mistakes or bad practice, please, let me know, I appreciate any feedback, Thanks

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

In this project I learn how to use an radio input, but only displaying the associated label element and give it a style that was needed.
At first I didn't understand the colors that were given, since I couldn't leave them as in the design, but after adding the radial-gradient, I saw how it changes the hue and I was able to get quite close to the original design using only the colors that were provided.
